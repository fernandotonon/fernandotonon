#### Side Projects

|Preview|Project||Description|Technologies|
|---|---|---|---|---|
||Clayground|2019 – Current| Clayground is a Qt-based toolset that allows using C++, JavaScript, and QML to rapidly develop apps in a sandbox environment with live loading capabilities. I’m participating in the development of this tool in association with a developer from Germany who started the project|C++, Qt/QML|
||Ludum Dare Game Jams|2019 – 2021|Some games I made for the 48h game contest, it is a competition that happens twice a year and gathers thousands of indie developers|Qt/QML, WebAssembly, Audacity, MSPaint, and Gimp|
||Montality|2013 – 2019|A game engine where I participated in the development team, which had up to 4 developers from different nationalities, Brazil, Germany, and India|C++, Qt/QML|
||HardUO|Jan 2012 – May 2013|A tool for helping to play Ultima Online. It allows creating macros in LUA Script for automating actions inside the game| C++, Qt, LUA|

I also contributed to the project OgreAssimp with minor bug fixing when building in the Linux system. A French contributor from the Ogre Community made a feature for splitting up to four different camera angles.|C++, Qt, Ogre, Assimp, CMake|
||Mineiro|Apr 2012|A labyrinth game I made for an internal competition at the software house I worked at the time|C++, SFML|
||Memory Game|April 2012|Made for a game contest. The game generates a sequence and the player should match it. The technical challenge in this game was playing a meme video when the player matched the sequence|C++, SDL, FFmpeg|
||Reinos Supremos|May 2012 – July 201|A multiplayer RTS game – Client-Server Architecture. Team: me and another developer and two 3D Designers|C++, Ogre3D, Qt, Boost::Asio, Protobuf, SQLite|
